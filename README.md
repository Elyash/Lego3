# Octavius

Octavius repository contains Lego3 plugin, components, and example for full test specification.

## Usage

We decided to separate between the code itself and the rest of the development helpers.

All of the documentation, guides, development helpers, etc. can be found in [Octavius-WorkStation](https://github.com/Elyash/Octavius-WorkStation) repository.
