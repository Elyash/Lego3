# Lego3 Example
As Lego3 has a different usage than the old Lego version, we've added a basic example.
Newcomers should look at this example and hopefully understand better the new features of Lego3.
The theme of this example is **the Zoo.**

## Components
### Giraffe
Giraffe is a very important component. Everybody could see the Giraffe because of it's long neck,
therefore we don't want to leave on it any unwanted logs.

### Zebra
Zebra isn't as important as a Giraffe, and most people don't even visit it when they go to the zoo.
Therefore we don't care if we leave on it any logs.
But, we have easy access to a Zebra and from there we can send information to other animals at the Zoo.

__Note:__ It's important to mention that both of these components support 
SSH, and have python installed on them.

## Tools

### Tetanus
Tetanus is the tool we developed for a Giraffe. Tetanus is a simple tool, it listens on a specific
port for UDP packets. Then it sends back the received data, to the animal who sent the packet.

## Setup
In our setup, we have only one Giraffe, whose name is "bob".
We also have 2 Zebras, one named "alice" and the other named "logan".
You could look at their configuration in [pytest.ini](/example/pytest.ini) (pytest configuration file).
